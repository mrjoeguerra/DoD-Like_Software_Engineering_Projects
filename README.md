# DoD-Style Flask Portfolio Projects (Sanitized)

This bundle contains **two** Python + Flask projects designed to resemble common
work patterns in a DoD-like environment **without** copying or revealing any classified
details.

Projects:
1) `secure-mission-tasking-portal/` — RBAC + JWT + audit logging + hardening patterns
2) `secure-sensor-data-gateway/` — HMAC signed ingest + anti-replay + quarantine lanes

Unzip, run locally, then push each folder as its own GitHub repo (recommended).
